Analyze the results, in terms of training and testing accuracy, data samples for which the neural network output is incorrect, and displays of activities and/or weights in hidden units to help understand how the neural network is making its decisions.\n"

    "\n",
    "Countless people have tried to predict where the stock will go to decide when and where to put their money. We believe that LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a recurrent neural network, can help us achieve that. The recurrent nature of the neural network is what makes it so interesting. LSTM is not a feedforward network but instead a feedback one.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent neural network perform well while predicting if the relevant information needed is close to the place it's needed. Unfortunately, as the gap between the information needed for predicting and where it's needed increases it becomes really hard for recurrent neural networks to predict. The problem is knowns as \"long-term dependencies\". LSTM's are special kinds of recurrent neural network which can solve long-term dependencies problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM's have a cell, an input gate, output gate and forget gate. These gates regulate the state of the cell. The first step inlcudes for the network to decide how much of information is to be let in or thrown away which is decided by the \"forget-gate\" layer. It has a sigmoid funtion which gives a value from 0 - 1, 0 means to be thrown away. The LSTM then decides what information it wants to retain in the cell state which is done by the sigmoid function in the input gate. The sigmoid function decide whose value in cell needs to be updated, where tanh creates a layer of new candidate values. Now, with the new values we update the value of the cell state. Next comes in the decision of what to be shown in output. The output depends on the filtered cell state values and to make that decision, we run sigmoid function throught it to decide what needs to be output. Now, we place the cell state with tanh activation function and multiply it with output of sigmoid function to output only things we decided. \n",
